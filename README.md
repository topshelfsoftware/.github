## Reusable GitHub Actions Workflows

### `repo-auto-tag.yaml`

Automatically tags a repository using the contents of a file named `VERSION` in the project root directory.

Usage:

```yaml
name: Tag Repository Call

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or any branch where you want to trigger the release workflow

jobs:
  tag-repo:
    uses: topshelfsoftware/.github/.github/workflows/repo-auto-tag.yaml@main
```

### `repo-create-release.yaml`

Automatically creates a release in a repository using the contents of a file named `VERSION` in the project root directory as the tag for the release.
Additionally, this workflow generates release notes that follows the same structure as GitHub's autogenerated release notes including
a `What's Changed` section with commit history and a `Full Changelog` between tag versions.

Usage:

```yaml
name: Call Create Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or any branch where you want to trigger the release workflow

jobs:
  create-release:
    uses: topshelfsoftware/.github/.github/workflows/repo-create-release.yaml@main
```
